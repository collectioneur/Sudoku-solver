This website enables rapid Sudoku solving of any difficulty level. Users input the initial Sudoku digits, and upon clicking the "solve" button, the Sudoku puzzle is solved. The frontend, managed by JavaScript, handles input fields and buttons, while the backend, powered by Java and Spring, is responsible for the algorithm and actual solving process. I enhanced the traditional brute-force Sudoku solving algorithm by implementing an algorithm that first fills in cells where only one digit is possible. If such cells are not found, it then resorts to value iteration. The entire algorithm operates recursively, ensuring efficient and accurate Sudoku solving.
